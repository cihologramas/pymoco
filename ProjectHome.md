This project is aiming to develop a standard API to interface motion controlers to Python programs. Initially it only supports a subset of the instructions supported by the Standa 8SMC1-USB stepper motor controller.

This wrapper is not a product from [STANDA](http://www.standa.lt/) nor is it in any way approved as such.

This project is developed by the technological development group of [CI Hologramas](http://www.cihologramas.com).

This software is in a very alpha state, and not ready for production use. Use it at your own risk.
